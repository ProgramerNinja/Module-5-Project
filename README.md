# Daily Task Scheduler

## Description

This is a simple appliction that allows the user to create a interactive list of things to do through-out the day.
Tasks are broken up to groups by hours. Each hour can be saved locally so that the task persists.
There is also a color scheme to help the user visually identify what is past, present, or future.
